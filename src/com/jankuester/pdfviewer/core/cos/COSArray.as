	An 
	ar
	ray object
	is a one-dimensional collection of objects arranged sequentially. Unlike arrays in many other 
	computer languages, PDF arrays may be heterogeneous; 
	that is, an arrayâ€™s elements may be any combination 
	of numbers, strings, dictionaries, or any other objects, including other arrays. An array may have zero 
	elements.
	An array shall be written as a sequence of object
	s enclosed 
	in SQUARE BRACKETS (using LEFT SQUARE 
	BRACKET (5Bh) and RIGHT 
	SQUARE BRACKET (5Dh)).
	EXAMPLE           [
	549
	3.14
	false
	(
	Ralph
	)
	/SomeName
	]
	PDF directly supports only one-dimensional arrays. Ar
	rays of higher dimension can be constructed by using 
	arrays as elements of arrays, nested to any depth.
